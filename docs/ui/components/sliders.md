# Slider

## Usage

Sliders allow users to view and select a value (or range) from the range along a bar. They’re ideal for adjusting
settings such as heights and distribution.

### Immediate effects

Changes made with sliders are immediate, allowing the user to make slider adjustments while determining a selection. 
Sliders shouldn’t be used to adjust settings with any delay in providing user feedback.

### Current state
